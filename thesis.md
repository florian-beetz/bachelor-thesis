## Java Programming Language

The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems under the name Oak in 1991 [@Oracle2015].
Oak was designed to be processor-independent and should be used in consumer electronics. 
In 1992 the industry had little interest in Oak, so the developers switched to bringing the language to the internet. 
The WebRunner browser was released in 1994, being the first browser supporting moving objects and dynamic executable content.
Due to trademark issues Oak was renamed to Java in 1995.
In the same year the developers of the Netscape Navigator browser announced that they will include Java support. The first version of Java was then released in 1996.
